Most said they yearn for peace but aren\u2019t sure it\u2019s realistic in the world they live in.\nOne young man said his brother died by suicide after being bullied relentlessly at school. Another talked about his best friend\u2019s murder on his grandma\u2019s porch. This same boy said a cousin was shot and then, just this summer, so was another friend on a bus.\n\u201cThat be putting me in my little moods,\u201d the teen, looking down, said during a recent session at a North Lawndale community center.\nA third teen shared how his brother was hit by a car and he saw him bloodied, lying on the street. His brother was still in pain a year later when their father died.\n\u201cI will laugh at some jokes,\u201d the young man said. \u201cAnd then I will get right back to the sad, depressed state because I think about all the tragic stuff that happened in my life.\u201d\nThese teens are being trained in a powerful set of principles of nonviolence inspired by Martin Luther King Jr. They are learning from their peers at North Lawndale College Prep, a charter school network. The trainers are called \u201cPeace Warriors.\u201d\nAssociates of King came up with the principles after he told them, just before his death, the next step in the movement was to institutionalize and operationalize nonviolence.\nAmong the principles: \u201cThe beloved community is the framework of the future;\u201d \u201cAttack forces of evil, not people doing evil;\u201d and \u201cAccept suffering without retaliation for the sake of the cause to achieve the goal.\u201d\nA former teacher, Tiffany Childress-Price, came up with the Peace Warriors effort after a year marked by 100 fights among students, said Gerald Smith, a restorative justice specialist at North Lawndale College Prep.\nOne of King\u2019s associates, Bernard Lafayette, came to the school in 2009 to help.\n\u201cHe says, \u2018I see that this school, on the West Side of Chicago, can become not only a haven, but a launching pad, for students and people embracing and living nonviolence and creating all kinds of necessary positive change,\u2019\u201d Smith recalled. \u201cAnd from that point, to this point, we\u2019ve just been engaged in the work.\u201d\nThe pandemic disrupted the efforts, like it did so many things. But, after spending this summer being trained and training others, the students are now once again playing a special role inside North Lawndale College Prep\u2019s two campuses.\nThe teens are called upon to prevent fights, break them up and to run peace circles. Wearing T-shirts that identify them as Peace Warriors, these teens also offer hugs and candy to students experiencing a tragedy.\nOver the years, the Peace Warriors\u2019 work has been instrumental in reducing the number of fights at the school, Smith said. It\u2019s even more important this year, he added, because there are more outbursts and conflicts at the school and elsewhere as students recover from the pandemic.\nThe Peace Warriors got started even before school began. They were tapped to train the incoming freshmen, to share \u201chow things are done at North Lawndale College Prep,\u201d said Jemia Cunningham-Elder, the interim chief executive director of the charter school network.\nSenior DaMarcus Thompson, who trained as a Peace Warrior three years ago, said he doesn\u2019t like to be in a school with a lot of fights. Becoming a Peace Warrior helped him feel empowered to change that. \u201cI felt like I can make a difference,\u201d he said.\nBut the work is not easy, especially out in the community. Some of the teenagers said in sessions this summer they don\u2019t believe people can be nonviolent if the violence or a threat is against them or a family member. The idea of suffering without retaliation is a difficult concept, and so is the sixth principle: The universe is on the side of justice.\nHere\u2019s how one young man put it in a group discussion: \u201cIf you see someone killed, you ain\u2019t going to be a peaceful person no more.\u201d\nEven the student trainers admitted they felt the urge to retaliate. Deanna Black, a quiet teenager with a cherub face, shared the story of the day her cousin was shot.\n\u201cThe police came and they said that he was in a foot chase, and so they chased him and they shot him in the back of his head,\u201d Deanna said. \u201cThey shot and killed my cousin and said it was suicide.\u201d\nDeanna said she often felt angry at the lack of justice for her cousin and wanted to do something about it.\nSmith, who is also a pastor, doesn\u2019t expect all of these teenagers will suddenly be transformed after simply being told the principles of nonviolence.\nStill, the work is essential, he said. It plants seeds throughout the community and helps the charter school become a haven for students.\nSarah Karp covers education for WBEZ.
