Video posted on social media showed the fire engulfing several palm trees near the venue before the flames were extinguished.\nAt one point the Los Angeles Fire Department asked the California Highway Patrol to shut down one lane of freeway traffic while they battled the flames.\nThe department later tweeted \"That somewhat stubborn fire near the @HollywoodBowl, our 1,423rd emergency of the day, thankfully involves only vegetation, and has not risen to the level of issuing an @LAFD ALERT.\"\nThe cause is under investigation.\nCity News Service contributed to this report.", "excerpt": "Firefighters quickly knocked down a \"stubborn\" fire near the Hollywood Bowl, but no injuries or structure damage was reported.", "content_length": 1249, "published_date": "2022-09-18T14:50:28Z", "language": "en", "domain": "abc7.com", "media": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/12237922_091822-kabc-7am-hollywood-bowl-tree-fire-vid.jpg?w=1600", "meta_info": {"dataset_id": "4bdd7054-d652-4733-8d43-690144670b84", "dataset": "news-cc", "dataset_content_length": "201650", "warc_sourced_date": "2022-09-18T14:58:11Z", "warc_extracted_date": "2022-09-18T17:01:22Z", "warc_processed_date": "2022-09-18T17:57:15Z"}, "id": "7c8c846c-116b-4aa0-a010-b194a09aec7e", "enriched_by": "NewsFetch", "enrichment_version": "1.0", "enriched_date": "2022-10-03T22:57:36Z", "enrichment_type": "inference", "model_source": "transformers", "model_name": "valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-1", "category": "zeroshot-classification", "parent": null, "classifications": [{"label": "entertainment", "confidence": 0.8437204360961914}, {"label": "travel", "confidence": 0.8014780879020691}]}
