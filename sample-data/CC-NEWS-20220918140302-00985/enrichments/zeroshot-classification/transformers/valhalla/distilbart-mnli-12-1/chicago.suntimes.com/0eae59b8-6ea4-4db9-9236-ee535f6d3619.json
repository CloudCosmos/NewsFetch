They are trying to find out more about this \u201cvast \u2018Censorship Enterprise\u2019 across a multitude of federal agencies,\u201d and the administration is fighting them every step of the way.\nSo far, Landry and Schmitt have identified 45 federal officials who \u201ccommunicate with social media platforms\u201d about curtailing \u201cmisinformation.\u201d Emails obtained during discovery show those platforms are desperate to comply with the government\u2019s demands for speech restrictions, including the removal of specific messages and accounts.\nColumnists bug Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.\nOn July 16, 2021, President Joe Biden accused Facebook of \u201ckilling people\u201d by failing to suppress misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. That same day, a senior executive at the platform\u2019s parent company emailed Surgeon General Vivek Murthy in an effort to assuage the president\u2019s anger.\n\u201cReaching out after what has transpired over the past few days following the publication of the misinformation advisory, and culminating today in the President\u2019s remarks about us,\u201d the Meta executive wrote. \u201cI know our teams met today to better understand the scope of what the White House expects from us on misinformation going forward.\u201d\nMurthy had just published an advisory in which he urged a \u201cwhole-of-society\u201d effort, possibly including \u201clegal and regulatory measures,\u201d to combat the \u201curgent threat to public health\u201d posed by \u201chealth misinformation.\u201d Biden\u2019s homicide charge came the next day, and Meta was keen to address the president\u2019s concerns by cracking down on speech that offended him.\nShortly afterward, Landry and Schmitt report, the same executive sent Murthy a text message. \u201cIt\u2019s not great to be accused of killing people,\u201d he said, adding that he was \u201ckeen to find a way to deescalate and work together collaboratively.\u201d\nAnd so he did. \u201cThanks again for taking the time to meet earlier today,\u201d the Meta executive said in a July 23, 2021, email to the Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cI wanted to make sure you saw the steps we took just this past week to adjust policies on what we are removing with respect to misinformation.\u201d\nThe executive bragged that Meta had deleted objectionable pages, groups and Instagram accounts, taken steps to make several pages and profiles \u201cmore difficult to find on our platform\u201d and \u201cexpanded the group of false claims that we remove.\u201d Other messages show that Twitter was equally eager to fall in line.\nSocial media companies have a First Amendment right to exercise editorial discretion. But that\u2019s not what is really happening when their decisions are shaped by implicit or explicit threats from the government.\nThe White House mentioned a few of those threats last week: \u201cantitrust legislation,\u201d privacy regulation and \u201cfundamental reforms\u201d to the law that shields platforms from liability for content posted by users. Given the broad powers that the federal government has to make life difficult for social media companies, the administration\u2019s \u201casks\u201d for stricter moderation are tantamount to commands.\nOpinion Newsletter Opinion This Week A weekly overview of opinions, analysis and commentary on issues affecting Chicago, Illinois and our nation by outside contributors, Sun-Times readers and the CST Editorial Board.\nSubscribe\nFederal officials expect obsequious compliance, and that is what they get. This largely surreptitious exercise in censorship by proxy, practiced by an administration that preaches transparency while practicing opacity, is especially troubling because it targets not only demonstrably false claims but also speech that the government considers \u201cmisleading\u201d or contrary to the prevailing \u201cconsensus.\u201d\nWhether the subject is the origins of COVID-19, the effectiveness of face masks or the newsworthiness of Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, that consensus often proves to be wrong. Both publicly and behind the scenes, federal officials are subverting the free inquiry and open debate required to reveal those errors.\nJacob Sullum is a senior editor at Reason magazine.\nThe Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds.
