# News Search Engine with OpenSearch

## Indexing Enrichments

The enrichments generated by the [newsfetch-enrichers](../newsfetch-enrichers) project are indexed into OpenSearch 
using the following command:

```bash
 PYTHONPATH=. python indexer.py --enrichments-base-dir=../../sample-data/CC-NEWS-20220918140302-00985/enrichments
````

This will index the enrichments into OpenSearch. The index name is `newsfetch`. The host is `localhost` and the port is `9200`.
These values are configurable via `config.py`

## Search UI with ReactiveSearch

It is assumed that NodeJS is installed and available in the path.

A [ReactiveSearch](https://docs.reactivesearch.io/) based search app can be created by running the following commands:

```bash
npx create-react-app news-search-ui

cd news-search-ui
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install @appbaseio/reactivesearch
```

The file App.js has been updated with the code that connects to a local instance of OpenSearch, 
into which the enrichments have been indexed.
